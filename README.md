# Hexapod-Navigation-DG
Repo for Masters Project on control and navigation algorithms for an existing 18 servo hexapod robot
This project is based on the work done in the master's theses of Cristopher Ross, Sheldon Erasmus and Philip Lotriet on development of the hexapod robot.
This robot is an 18 servo mechanical system driven by a Jetson Nano and Teensy. It has an RGBD camera to observe the terrain and adapt to it.
In particular this repo will focus on duplicating their control methods and then extending them to more complex uneven terrain and similar applications of interest. The system will also be upgraded to run on modern ROS2 middleware.

# ToDo
Add code for the Simscape simulation. Add setup instructions 
Add the hexapod code for both the teensy and the Jetson
Add instructions referencing hardware description and setup.
Add description of software setup for hexapod.
